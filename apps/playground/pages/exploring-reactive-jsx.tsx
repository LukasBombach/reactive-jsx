        <P>What if you could write components like this?</P>

        <P>
          No need for <Code>useState</Code> or <Code>setCode</Code>, all you need to do is declare a variable and change
          it. The DOM will update accordingly. That's good, right? It's easy. It's straight forward.

          <Code>Context</Code> can become cumbersome. In my mind, what I am doing with <Code>Context</Code>, is
          declaring a variable and sharing it across multiple components. It should be as easy as that.

          It is possible to do this. By transpiling the{" "}
          <em className="pb-px border-b-[3px] border-b-sky-300">simple code that expresses your intention</em>, to more{" "}
          <em className="pb-px border-b-[3px] border-b-rose-300">verbose code that makes this happen</em>.
        </P>
        <P>
          The intention behind this, is that code should be readable. By readable, I mean that it communicates what it
          is supposed to do in simple terms and with little noise from helper code.
        </P>
        <P>
          I have yet to see someone express this as eloquently as the author of Svelte, Rich Harris, in his talk{" "}
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzX4aTRPzno" className="text-sky-600">
            <em>Write Less, Do More</em> at the JSCAMP 2019
          </a>
          . And of course a big chunk of the infamous Book "Clean Code" by Uncle Bob explores this idea in detail.

        <P>
          While Svelte is a <em>good framework</em>, it comes with batteries included, an extra battery pack and a
          docking station for all your needs. This is a matter of liking and use-case, but I am not a fan of themplate
          languages, <em>personally</em>. Am I willing to go as far as <Code>JSX</Code>, but Svelte deviates from
          standard ecma too much <em>for my liking</em>.

        <P>Reactive JSX works event without Componets, it just returns DOM elements (example withuot compoenents)</P>
