        <P>What if you could write components like this?</P>

        <P>
          No need for <Code>useState</Code> or <Code>setCode</Code>, all you need to do is declare a variable and change
          it. The DOM will update accordingly. That's good, right? It's easy. It's straight forward.

          <Code>Context</Code> can become cumbersome. In my mind, what I am doing with <Code>Context</Code>, is
          declaring a variable and sharing it across multiple components. It should be as easy as that.

          It is possible to do this. By transpiling the{" "}

        <P>
          The intention behind this, is that code should be readable. By readable, I mean that it communicates what it
          is supposed to do in simple terms and with little noise helper code.
